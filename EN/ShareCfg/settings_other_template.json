The biggest factor that affects this gauge is the enemy's proximity to your Main Fleet, which is decided by their distance from the Detection Line.\n\nHowever, other factors affect this gauge as well. The Detection Gauge increases:\n- When an enemy crosses the Detection Line\n- When an enemy ship or aircraft reaches the left-hand side of the screen\n- When a friendly carrier launches an Airstrike\n- When the skills of certain friendly carriers activate\n- When a friendly carrier catches fire (when this happens, the Detection Gauge will not go below a certain threshold until the fire is put out)\n\nThe Detection Gauge will decrease as long as there are no enemies past the Detection Line.\nEach carrier has a separate Detection Gauge, and the higher their EVA stat, the longer it will take for them to be Detected.\n\nThe Detection Gauge During Exercises:\nThe Detection Gauge will not decrease in Exercise Battles. Additionally, once the opponent's fleet gets near enough to your Main Fleet, all of your carriers will enter the Detected state.\n",
