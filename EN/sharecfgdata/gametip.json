The benefits of these actions are as follows:\n- Clean: grants upgrade points for your Comf-Forts.\n- Play: grants upgrade points for your Comf-Forts, and you have a chance to receive Cat Box Quick Finishers.\n- Feed: Grants upgrade points for your Comf-Forts, and increases the EXP your Meowfficers earn in their Comf-Forts.\n\nUpgrading your Comf-Forts will give you access to additional Comf-Fort slots, Comf-Fort themes, and increase the EXP your Meowfficers earn while in a Comf-Fort."

However, if the enemy submarine leaves your Vanguard Fleet's scan range, they will return to being undetected after some time has passed.\n\n- How your Scan Range is Calculated:\nThe following 4 factors affect the size of your Vanguard Fleet's Submarine Scan Range:\n1. The greatest base ASW stat among the DDs and CLs in your Vanguard Fleet.\n2. The combined ASW stat of all ships in your Main Fleet.\n3. The additional range granted by equipping a sonar on your ships.\n4. Certain miscellaneous map-specific buffs/debuffs, the stats and skills of enemy ships, etc.\n\nImportant note: any bonus points to the ASW stat gained from gear, skills, Meowfficers, or Fleet Tech does NOT affect your Scan Range.\n"

Each stage has its own ACV, which is then compared against your ACV to establish which side has Airspace Control, and to what extent.\n\nYour Airspace Control status affects the following:\n1. How much damage your fleets' Airstrikes deal\n2. How much damage your fleets take from enemy aircraft\n3. The Accuracy, Evasion, and Recon Value of your fleets (to a small degree)\n\nWhen your ACV is lower than that of the stage's, you will lose control over the airspace, which impacts your fleets negatively.\nYou can check your Airspace Control status by tapping on its icon, located near the top left side of the screen when in a sortie.\n\nAirspace Control Value Calculation:\nThe following factors are used to calculate your ACV:\n1. The number of plane-carrying ships in your fleets when sortieing (specifically: CVs, CVLs, BBVs, and SSVs)\n2. The combined Aviation stat of your fleets\n3. The types and number of aircraft your plane-carrying ships have (Fighters, Bombers, Torpedo Bombers, and Seaplanes)\nYour current ACV can be found on the sortie screen before entering a stage. If your ACV is lower than the recommended value, you may want to make changes to your fleet formation to increase it.\n\nThe following factors determine how high the stage's ACV is:\n1. The chapter and subchapter (the later the stage, the higher the ACV will generally be)\n2. The combined Anti-Air stat of your fleets\n3. For Hard Mode stages: whether or not you have unlocked and enabled Clearing Mode on that particular stage\n\n- General Tips:\n1. When one of your ships sink, whatever stats they contributed to your ACV will be ignored, and your ACV will decrease accordingly.\n2. Of the 4 types of aircraft, Fighters contribute the most to your ACV. Dive Bombers contribute the second most, followed by Torpedo Bombers, then Seaplanes. If you want to significantly increase your ACV, sortie with CVs that have a lot of Fighters.\n3. Even a fleet that is not actively in combat with an enemy node still contributes to your ACV."

        "info": "Module Development: this Daily Raid can be attempted twice a week. Your goal is to destroy all enemies.\n- The enemies fire <color=#92fc63>special smoke shells</color> which drastically reduce your Main Fleet's ACC and DMG dealt upon scoring a hit.\n- Additionally, the enemies perform <color=#92fc63>slash attacks</color> which are capable of clearing some of your cannon fire and torpedoes.\n\nSupply Line Disruption\n1. Supply Line Disruption is available every day of the week.\n2. During this Daily Challenge, you'll be able to manually control your Submarines on a special stage and claim rewards by sinking enemy Cargo Ships.\n3. This Daily Challenge is available every day of the week, but you can only clear it 2 times per week.\n4. Submarines control differently from other vessels. They can't fire Salvos or launch Airstrikes, but instead, they have an ability called Dive.\n5. Additionally, they have an Emergency Boost that gives a short speed boost, a Torpedo Attack with limited uses, and an All Out Assault that they can use once.\n6. Furthermore, you can tap the icon in the top left corner to change which Submarine you're controlling.\n7. Once you clear the stage by sinking the Cargo Ships at the end of it, the points you earned during the Daily Challenge will be tallied\n8. You'll also receive Submarine and Anti-Sub gear based on how well you did.\n9. Points are given for clearing the stage, sinking enemies, and completing the stage without any of your Submarines sinking.\n10. Remember that your Submarines depend on their torpedoes to deal damage, so try to make every shot count.\n\nTips:\n1. Equipping your Submarine correctly will give them more ammunition to use. Both Auxiliary and Main Weapon torpedoes count!\n2. Submarine skills don't work during the Daily Challenge, so plan your strategy accordingly.\n3. However, they can still use their All Out Assaults once.\n4. Surcouf will fire her All Out Assault automatically when she resurfaces, but like all other Submarines, she can only fire it once.\n5. All Out Assaults deal increased damage to enemies during this Daily Challenge.\n6. You can't change to another Submarine to control immediately after Diving or Resurfacing.\n\nEscort Cargo is available on Mondays, Thursdays, and Sundays.\n\nMaritime Attack is available on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.\n\nFierce Assault is available on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.\n\nTactical Training is available every day of the week.\n\n<color=#92fc63>Airstrikes</color> are highly effective for <color=#92fc63>Tactical Training (Aviation)</color>.\n<color=#92fc63>Main Fleet Salvos</color> are highly effective for <color=#92fc63>Tactical Training (Shelling)</color>.\n<color=#92fc63>Vanguard Torpedoes</color> are highly effective for <color=#92fc63>Tactical Training (Torpedo)</color>.\n\nCompleting a Daily Raid stage with an S rating will unlock the quick battle option for that stage.\n- Quick battle allows you to challenge that stage multiple times at once.\n- Carrying out quick battles will skip the battle and grant you rewards according to the number of battles carried out.\n- Quick battles do not consume Oil, but also do not grant Commander or Ship EXP.\n- Quick battles will not affect the Morale or Affinity of your ships.\n- Quick battle sortie victories will not affect your number of victories or victory rate on your profile page.\n- Quick battles count towards the progress of certain missions such as:\n  Obtain victory with a B/A/S rating.\n  Complete Daily Raids.\n  Defeat small/medium/large fleets.\n- Quick battles will not count towards the completion of character story missions."

Tapping the bell rope when you have Shrine Visits will consume 5 coins and grant a blessing.\n\nThere are several types of blessings with several different effects:\n\nEducation: Reduces the time it takes to train in the Tactical Academy.\n\nCareer: Our fleet gets a damage bonus in main story, hard mode, and battle record sorties.\n\nRomance: Your secretary ship gains affection faster.\n\nBlessings remain in effect for one day.\n\n3. An education blessing will not reduce the training time of any lesson in progress when the blessing is activated.\n\nThe expiration of the education blessing will not cause any lesson in progress to lengthen.\n\n4. Should you pray for a new blessing when a blessing is already in effect, the new blessing will override the existing one, and its duration will reset.\n\n5. You may only have one active blessing at any one time."

        "info": "\n1. Starting Development:\nYou can begin development on a PR/DR shipgirl once you meet her development requirements, which are shown at the center of the Shipyard screen when a shipgirl has been selected.\nTo start developing a shipgirl, select one and tap the Commence button. You can only develop 1 PR or DR shipgirl at a time.\n\n2. Development Tasks:\nThe shipgirl you've chosen to develop will unlock after you complete all her development tasks.\nAfter starting development, you will immediately gain access to the first task, and each subsequent task will unlock in order at 24-hour intervals.\nSome tasks may have prerequisites before you can begin making progress.\n\n3. Changing Your Development Target:\nAlthough you cannot develop 2 shipgirls at once, you are able to switch which one you're currently developing before you complete all tasks.\nAny progress you've made on your current development tasks, as well as the unlocked tasks themselves, will be saved if you choose to switch development targets.\nOnce you do this, you must wait 24 hours before you can change targets again.\n\n4. Completing Development:\nUpon completing all development tasks for a shipgirl, she will join your dock and you unlock the ability to Enhance her.\nTo begin development on a new PR or DR shipgirl, you must go to the Development Dock and select one. New development targets are not chosen automatically.\n\n5. Enhancing PR Or DR Ships:\nIn contrast to ordinary shipgirls, PR/DR shipgirls require Blueprints to be Enhanced. Blueprints are mainly acquired through conducting research at the Research Academy.\nEnhancing a PR/DR shipgirl will raise her stats, unlock new skills, and give her new abilities, similar to ordinary shipgirls.\n6. Enhancing with Coins:\nSome PR/DR shipgirls can also be Enhanced and undergo Fate Simulation with Coins as a substitute for Blueprints. \nThe Coin cost depends on how many times you've used this method of Enhancement previously in a day, as well as whether the shipgirl is classified as a PR or a DR. The first 15 times each day are discounted.\nThe following tables list the Coin cost per number of Blueprints substituted:\n\nFor a PR shipgirl:\n1 to 2: Free\n3 to 4: 90% discount\n5 to 7: 80% discount\n8 to 9: 60% discount\n10 to 15: 30% discount\n16 and onward: 0% discount; Blueprints cost 1,500 Coins each.\n\nFor a DR shipgirl:\n1 to 2: Free\n3 to 6: 90% discount\n7 to 10: 80% discount\n11 to 15: 50% discount\n16 and onward: 0% discount; Blueprints cost 6,000 Coins each.\n\nThe game will automatically calculate the Coin cost for you when using this method of Enhancement. The Coin cost resets daily at 4:00 AM.\n\n7. PR/DR Shipgirl Level Caps:\nPR/DR shipgirls do not need to be Limit Broken to be able to reach level 100. However, past that, you must still use Cognitive Chips and Coins to further increase their level caps. \n\n8. Fate Simulation:\nOnce a PR/DR shipgirl reaches Development Level 30, she can undergo Fate Simulation, etching a historical record of sorts into her hull to be more akin to a standard shipgirl.\nIn gameplay terms, Fate Simulation will allow you to use additional Blueprints to further enhance the capabilities of your PR/DR shipgirl.\nFate Simulation is done in 5 steps. The first 4 steps grant a boost to the shipgirl's Luck stat, and the final 5th step grants an upgrade to one of her skills.\nYou can also use Coins in place of Blueprints. Please refer to section 6 above for more details.\n\n9. Battle Simulations:\nYou can preview the performance of certain PR/DR shipgirls through the Battle Simulation mode.\nTo access it, simply select a shipgirl and tap the Battle Simulation button. You will then be sent into a special battle with the shipgirl you selected.\n\nPlease note that the shipgirls' stats and loadouts are preset in this mode, and may not accurately reflect their real performance.\n\n- Skin Projection Overview -\n1. The skin projection feature unlocks once a PR/DR shipgirl reaches level 100.\n2. This will give you access to personal missions. Completing them will allow you to create a skin projection for the shipgirl in question.\n3. The skin projections you create can be applied on the secretary slots on the main menu.\n4. You can manage your skin projections from the Shipyard or from the details screen for the shipgirl who has it.\n"

When summoned in a battle, they will both use Ammunition and consume Oil.\n\n- The Submarine Fleet has 2 settings: Support Mode (the fleet will be on standby) and Attack Mode (the fleet will attack enemies automatically.)\n- This setting can be changed at any time from the Formation menu on the right side of the screen when sortieing.\n\nAttack/Support Range Level:\n- The higher the ASR level the Submarine Fleet's Flagship is, the further from their starting location they can attack or provide support.\n\n- You can increase the ASR level through Limit Breaking your Submarines, leveling certain skills, and equipping them with certain gear."

These can be viewed from the Missions menu.\n2) By sortieing and defeating Boss fleets in Campaign Chapters 3 and above to earn a Certificate of Support.\nCommanders can use their Certificates of Support on the Campaign overworld screen or the Popularity Poll banner to receive Support Points.\nSupport Points will in turn give the commander Ballots based on how many Points they earned.\nCommanders can then use their Ballots to vote for their favorite shipgirls with the Vote button on the Popularity Poll banner.\nBe aware that once each step of the Poll has concluded, all unspent Ballots will disappear from your inventory.\n\n- More Info about Certificates of Support:\n\n1. Commanders can obtain a Certificate of Support by defeating Boss nodes on Campaign (Normal mode only) and Event maps (excluding through War Archives.)\n2. Commanders can only possess 1 Certificate of Support at a time. It can be used on the Campaign overworld map or from the Popularity Poll banner.\n3. When using their Certificate of Support, commanders will be sent to a screen with the chibi sprites of several characters. By tapping the chibis in the direction that the Manjuu is pointing, the Certificate of Support will be spent and the commander will receive Support Points.\n4. The Certificate of Support will disappear from your inventory if not used within a certain time.\n5. Certificates of Support obtained from higher level Campaign maps give more Support Points. The number of points earned per Chapter is shown in the table below:\n\nChapter 3: 120 Points\nChapter 4: 150 Points\nChapter 5: 180 Points\nChapter 6: 220 Points\nChapter 7: 270 Points\nChapter 8: 350 Points\nChapter 9: 450 Points\nChapter 10: 550 Points\nChapter 11: 700 Points\nChapter 12: 850 Points\nChapter 13: 1,000 Points\nChapter 14: 1,150 Points."

The ice cream will be handed to them after you've chosen the same number of ingredients as they ask for, then you'll receive a new order.\n3. Your score and the customer's reaction depend on if you got their order correct or not. How long it took you to pick the toppings and flavors and if they were the right ones or not also influence your score.\n4. The minigame ends once the timer reaches 0 or when you quit the game early.\n\n- Combo Bonuses -\n· When you get a customer's order exactly right, there is a chance that the countdown timer for the next ice cream order will move slower for 4 seconds. This bonus cannot activate again until 5 seconds after it expires.\n· When you get 2 orders exactly right in a row, 2 seconds will be added to the next order countdown timer.\n· When you get 2 orders exactly right in a row from the same customer, you gain twice as many points from the next customer. This bonus can only activate once per unique customer."

Once you get a certain prize, it will not appear again during the duration of the Stellar Prize Draw.\n· S-grade prizes are special in that you may change the order you acquire them if you so like.\n3. The Stellar Prize Draw lineup is exclusive to each limited period during which it runs. Once one run of it ends, the next one will have a different lineup of prizes.\n4. During a single Stellar Prize Draw run, once you've won a certain number of prizes, you may select a prize from the Total Draws shown on the Stellar Prize Draw menu. Your total number of draws is reset between individual runs of the Stellar Prize Draw.\n5. When a given run of the Stellar Prize Draw ends, if you have yet to obtain all the prizes and you still possess any Stellar Tickets, as many of them as possible will automatically be used in order to give you all the prizes.\n· If you've won all the prizes, any leftover Stellar Tickets will be converted to Gems.\n· Prizes and Gems obtained through the above method will be sent to your Mailbox."

Finishing every case will unlock the endless mode.\nThis mini-event is available between <color=#92fc63>September 14th and October 4th, 23:59</color>.\n\n- Rewards -\n1. Using the Youkai Talismans you earned from playing the minigame, you can exchange for items in the shop, such as limited furniture, gear skin boxes, and new characters to use in the minigame.\n2.

The active skill can be engaged by tapping the button on the bottom of the screen.\n· Achieving certain character-specific feats and completing missions in the minigame will reward you with Youkai Talismans."

About the Detection Gauge:\n\nThe Detection Gauge represents how close the enemy is to detecting the presence of your carriers. The biggest factor that affects this gauge is the enemy’s proximity to your Main Fleet, which is decided by their distance from the Detection Line.\n\nHowever, other factors affect this gauge as well. The Detection Gauge increases:\n\n- When an enemy crosses the Detection Line\n\n- When an enemy ship or aircraft reaches the left-hand side of the screen\n\n- When a friendly carrier launches an Airstrike\n\n- When the skills of certain friendly carriers activate\n\n- When a friendly carrier catches fire (when this happens, the Detection Gauge will not go below a certain threshold until the fire is put out)\n\nThe Detection Gauge will decrease as long as there are no enemies past the Detection Line.\n\nEach carrier has a separate Detection Gauge, and the higher their AVI stat, the longer it will take for them to be Detected.\n\n2. The Detection Gauge During Exercises:\n\nThe Detection Gauge will not decrease in Exercise Battles. Additionally, once the opponent’s fleet gets near enough to your Main Fleet, all of your carriers will enter the Detected state."

Each time you complete one, you receive one Die Roll.\nYou can then tap the button on the bottom right of the event banner to move around the castle and investigate. On the investigation screen, you may use your Die Rolls to unlock new areas to search for clues.\nTapping on a searchable area will initiate the story.\n\nYour rolls on the investigation screen can end in either success or failure. When your roll succeeds, you unlock 2 new searchable areas, while if it fails, you only unlock 1.\nDifferent story events will play out depending on where you investigate. If you get a game over, you will automatically be returned to the point you were before. This will not count as a Die Roll, and you can try for a roll even if you have 0 attempts.\n\nYou will unlock rewards based on the amount of areas you have investigated, such as the limited furniture, Dice of Destiny.\nAfter you have read the whole story, you unlock the character creation function which lets you create a profile for your investigator.\n\n· Character Creation\nFinishing the whole story will unlock the character creation function.\nHere, you can input a name to generate a random investigator's profile.\n"

        "info": "- Augment Modules Overview - \nAugment Modules are a special type of gear. A shipgirl must be at Max Limit Break to equip them, unless she is a META ship, a blueprint ship (PR/DR) or a ship of UR rarity.\nThese modules can, among other things, raise your shipgirls' stats, improve certain skills, and clear incoming enemy shells.\n\nShipgirls can only equip one module each, and some modules may only be equipped by specific shipgirls.\nYour modules are stored in a depot separate from your primary Gear Depot.\n\n- Obtaining Augment Modules -\nModules can be obtained through a Daily Raid and crafting.\nThe Daily Raid can be attempted up to twice per week, and is split into 2 types of missions. One yields Augment Modules, the other yields materials used on Augment Modules.\nModules can be crafted either from the Craft tab on the Depot menu, or through the Augment gear slot on the Dock screen.\n\nCrafting these modules requires Augment Module Cores and Coins. However, doing so will also let you use Augment Module Stones and spare Augment Modules to craft modules with higher starting Upgrade EXP.\nYou can also craft unique modules for shipgirls who have them. This is done via the crafting menu on the Dock screen for applicable shipgirls.\n\n- Augment Module Attributes -\nModule attributes are divided into 3 categories: base stats, conversion attributes, and module effects.\n\n· Base Stats\nBase stats are the module's inherent statistics, which vary based on the particular module. These stats can be increased by upgrading and uncapping the module.\nUpgrading a module requires Upgrade EXP, which is granted through the use of Augment Module Stones and the recycling of spare Augment Modules.\nUncapping requires Augment Module Cores, Coins, and upgrade materials. Uncapping increases a module's rarity and also resets its Upgrade Level. Currently, modules can only be upgraded from Rare to Elite rarity.\n\n· Conversion Attributes\nConversion attributes are variable stats, determined randomly within a value range specific to a given module.\nThese attributes can be rerolled through the use of Augment Module Stones. When you reroll a module's attributes, you can choose to either apply the change to overwrite the previous attributes, or cancel the conversion.\n\n· Module Effects\nModule effects are special effects that unlock after you've upgraded a given module to a certain level.\nSome unique modules also have effects that improve the skills of the particular shipgirl associated with it.\n\n- Augment Module Behavior in Combat -\nSome modules have a slash attack as their module effect. This attack is capable of clearing enemy shells and is activated automatically.\nThe slash attack's pattern and range, as well as the ammo type it is capable of clearing, all depend on the kind of Augment Module equipped as well as the hull type of the shipgirl equipping it and how many have it equipped.\n\nShipgirls with this type of Augment Module can store up to 1 slash attack.\nWhen she has a slash attack charged, she will perform it automatically either after taking damage, or after 5 seconds pass without her having taken damage.\nThe slash attack will start recharging after it is performed. All slash attacks require 15 seconds to recharge."

If you possess enough Blueprints to fully Enhance (including Fate Simulation) a PR/DR, you will no longer get Catch-Up research projects specific to that ship.\nFor example, if you only have Monarch fully Fate Simulated (or have enough Blueprints to do so) among all PR1 ships and set your Research Focus to PR1 ships, you will receive projects for all PR1 ships except Monarch.\n\nIf you have Research Focus set to a specific PR/DR series and you've fully Enhanced all ships from that series (or have enough Blueprints to do so), you will get research projects for all ships from that series.\nConversely, if you have Research Focus disabled, you will only receive research projects for ships that you've not fully Enhanced (or have enough Blueprints to do so for).\n\nOtherwise, the amount of Blueprints you possess for a given ship does not affect your probability of getting research projects for her.\n\n\n- Update -\nThe Research Academy has received an update with the addition of series 3 PRs/DRs.\n\n1. New series 3 research projects have been added.\nSeries 3 research projects are marked with the roman numeral \"III\" in the top right corner of the project.\n\n2. The Research Focus menu has been completely revamped.  Now when you wish to focus on a particular PR/DR series, you can choose between series 1, 2, and 3.\nFocusing on a series will increase the likelihood you'll get research projects from the corresponding series, with at least 3 of them guaranteed to be from the chosen series.\n\nAdditionally, with the new Catch-Up feature, you can prioritize a ship of a given PR/DR series and receive additional Blueprints for her.\nSetting an active Catch-Up ship is done through the Research Focus menu."

It is required to initiate a META Showdown against a past META ship.\n· You can obtain up to <color=#92fc63>200</color> data every day. Data below the cap that went unused will carry over into the next day.\n· It costs <color=#92fc63>100</color> data to initiate a Showdown against a past META ship.\n\n- Setting and Changing Analysis Targets -\nOnce you've unlocked a META ship's dossier on the Dossier Analysis screen, you may initiate a Showdown against her.\n· You may freely switch to another META ship if you want to analyze her dossier instead.\n\n- Dossier Analysis Showdowns -\nYour first attempt at a Showdown does not cost Oil. Your Oil cost decreases with each subsequent attempt, starting at <color=#92fc63>40</color> and eventually reaching <color=#92fc63>0</color>.\nShowdowns initiated via Dossier Analysis do not count toward the daily cap on ordinary META Showdowns.\n· You gain Sync Points for the META ship you're after once her HP reaches 0.\n· A Showdown remains active for 24 hours. If you do not finish it within this time, you will have to reinitiate the fight.\n· Dossier Analysis Showdowns have a fixed Corrosion Level of 15.\n\n- Support in Dossier Analysis Showdowns -\nFriends and members of the same Guild who have unlocked Dossier Analysis can assist each other during Showdowns.\n<color=#92fc63>Assisting a friend or guildmate does not yield any rewards, but neither does it cost Oil nor consume your daily Showdown attempts.</color>\n· Up to 30 players may participate in the same Showdown.\n\n- Showdown Combat Overview -\nMuch like with ordinary META Showdowns, submarines and Meowfficers cannot participate in Dossier Analysis Showdowns.\nShipgirls taking part in the Showdown do not gain EXP, but they also do not lose Morale.\nYou cannot stop a battle once it has begun. If the game is exited at any point during the battle, one of the following penalties is applied:\n· If you are the Showdown's initiator, any spent Oil is not reimbursed, and all your damage dealt in that battle is negated.\n· If you are assisting another player, all your damage dealt in that battle is negated.\n\n- Auto-Deploy Overview -\nAfter you've initiated a Dossier Analysis Showdown and completed the first attempt, the Auto-Deploy feature becomes available for the rest of that Showdown.\nThe Oil cost of running Auto-Deploy is based on how much damage you dealt to the META ship on the first attempt. This damage is used to calculate how many battles it will take to defeat the META ship and, subsequently, the total Oil cost of those battles.\n· Using Auto-Deploy costs the same amount of Oil as fighting the META ship manually, with an Oil cap of 200.\n· Auto-Deploy will automatically defeat the META ship in 15 minutes unless you disable it manually. Doing so does not reimburse the spent Oil and all your damage dealt is negated."

Sync Points can be used to obtain the limited character, <color=#92fc63>Yuudachi META</color> as well as other great rewards.\n<color=#ff5c5c>Note: Sync Points will expire after the event period ends.</color>\n\n- Acquiring and Analyzing META Coordinates -\n· META Coordinates can be earned by playing Operation Siren. Sufficient amounts of META Coordinates can be analyzed to begin a META Showdown.\n· You may perform Analysis <color=#92fc63>2 times</color> per day, resetting every day at midnight. Unused META Coordinates will be retained.\n· You need <color=#92fc63>100</color> META Coordinates to begin a META Showdown.\n\n- Fighting Your Bosses -\n· Your first time challenging a META boss that you spawned will not require Oil. From the second attempt onwards, cost of each attempt will gradually drop from <color=#92fc63>40</color> Oil to <color=#92fc63>0</color> Oil. (Will not consume a challenge attempt).\n· When a META Showdown boss reaches 0 HP, they will be defeated. Participants will be able to collect rewards, including a large amount of Sync Points.\n· Each META Showdown will only last for <color=#92fc63>24 hours</color>, after which it will disappear. Use Request Support if you need help.\n· After defeating a META boss, the difficulty of subsequent META Showdowns will increase by 1 level, up to a maximum of 15.\n\n- Fighting Others' Bosses -\n· In the Boss List menu, you can see requests that other Commanders have sent. When fighting another Commander's boss, you will immediately gain Sync Points based upon the <color=#92fc63>amount of DMG</color> you dealt.\n· Each attempt uses 1 Challenge Attempt, but uses no Oil.\n· You can have up to <color=#92fc63>3</color> Challenge attempts, resetting each day at midnight.\nEach META Showdown can have up to 30 participants.\n\n- Combat Instructions -\n· You cannot bring Meowfficers or submarines.\n· At the end of battle, no EXP is gained, and Morale will not be affected.\n· You cannot quit during an META Showdown. If connection is lost due to unstable network conditions, the following will occur:\na. If challenging a boss you discovered, you will spend 40 Oil (the first battle is still free), and any damage done will not count.\nb. If challenging someone else's boss, a challenge attempt will be used, but no rewards will be granted.\n<color=#92fc63>Please make sure your network conditions are stable before attempting an META Showdown!</color>\n\n- Artillery Support -\nFrom the 31st day of this META Showdown season onwards, whenever you begin an META Showdown, your fleet will gain an additional wave of artillery support. This artillery support will deal damage to the enemy and apply a special debuff that inflicts damage over time (this damage cannot be amplified by any bonus effects).\nThe later in the META Showdown season it is, the greater the damage inflicted by this artillery support.\n*Artillery Support will only appear during META Showdown battles you discover, and will trigger with each challenge attempt."
