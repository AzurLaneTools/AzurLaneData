One new round a day is unlocked during the event period.\n· Press and hold the Meowfficer to change the curling stone's launch speed. The longer you press, the faster it will go. Let go when you wish to launch the curling stone.\n· While your finger is on the Meowfficer, you move it up and down on the screen to change the curling stone's course.\n· The curling stone's course will change if it bumps into an object.\n· When the curling stone comes to a stop, you will score points based on which circle it stopped inside. Stopping in the blue circle gives you 300 points, the yellow circle gives you 500 points, and the red circle gives you 1,000 points."

The additional range granted by equipping a sonar on your ships.\n4.

Each stage has its own ACV, which is then compared against your ACV to establish which side has Airspace Control, and to what extent.\n\nYour Airspace Control status affects the following:\n1. How much damage your fleets' Airstrikes deal\n2. How much damage your fleets take from enemy aircraft\n3. The Accuracy, Evasion, and Recon Value of your fleets (to a small degree)\n\nWhen your ACV is lower than that of the stage's, you will lose control over the airspace, which impacts your fleets negatively.\nYou can check your Airspace Control status by tapping on its icon, located near the top left side of the screen when in a sortie.\n\nAirspace Control Value Calculation:\nThe following factors are used to calculate your ACV:\n1. The number of plane-carrying ships in your fleets when sortieing (specifically: CVs, CVLs, BBVs, and SSVs)\n2. The combined Aviation stat of your fleets\n3. The types and number of aircraft your plane-carrying ships have (Fighters, Bombers, Torpedo Bombers, and Seaplanes)\nYour current ACV can be found on the sortie screen before entering a stage. If your ACV is lower than the recommended value, you may want to make changes to your fleet formation to increase it.\n\nThe following factors determine how high the stage's ACV is:\n1. The chapter and subchapter (the later the stage, the higher the ACV will generally be)\n2. The combined Anti-Air stat of your fleets\n3. For Hard Mode stages: whether or not you have unlocked and enabled Clearing Mode on that particular stage\n\n- General Tips:\n1. When one of your ships sink, whatever stats they contributed to your ACV will be ignored, and your ACV will decrease accordingly.\n2. Of the 4 types of aircraft, Fighters contribute the most to your ACV. Dive Bombers contribute the second most, followed by Torpedo Bombers, then Seaplanes. If you want to significantly increase your ACV, sortie with CVs that have a lot of Fighters.\n3. Even a fleet that is not actively in combat with an enemy node still contributes to your ACV."

Your goal is to destroy all enemies.\n- The enemies fire <color=#92fc63>special smoke shells</color> which drastically reduce your Main Fleet's ACC and DMG dealt upon scoring a hit.\n- Additionally, the enemies perform <color=#92fc63>slash attacks</color> which are capable of clearing some of your cannon fire and torpedoes.\n\nSupply Line Disruption\n1. Supply Line Disruption is available every day of the week.\n2. During this Daily Challenge, you'll be able to manually control your Submarines on a special stage and claim rewards by sinking enemy Cargo Ships.\n3. This Daily Challenge is available every day of the week, but you can only clear it 2 times per week.\n4. Submarines control differently from other vessels. They can't fire Salvos or launch Airstrikes, but instead, they have an ability called Dive.\n5. Additionally, they have an Emergency Boost that gives a short speed boost, a Torpedo Attack with limited uses, and an All Out Assault that they can use once.\n6. Furthermore, you can tap the icon in the top left corner to change which Submarine you're controlling.\n7. Once you clear the stage by sinking the Cargo Ships at the end of it, the points you earned during the Daily Challenge will be tallied\n8. You'll also receive Submarine and Anti-Sub gear based on how well you did.\n9. Points are given for clearing the stage, sinking enemies, and completing the stage without any of your Submarines sinking.\n10. Remember that your Submarines depend on their torpedoes to deal damage, so try to make every shot count.\n\nTips:\n1. Equipping your Submarine correctly will give them more ammunition to use. Both Auxiliary and Main Weapon torpedoes count!\n2. Submarine skills don't work during the Daily Challenge, so plan your strategy accordingly.\n3. However, they can still use their All Out Assaults once.\n4. Surcouf will fire her All Out Assault automatically when she resurfaces, but like all other Submarines, she can only fire it once.\n5. All Out Assaults deal increased damage to enemies during this Daily Challenge.\n6. You can't change to another Submarine to control immediately after Diving or Resurfacing.\n\nEscort Cargo is available on Mondays, Thursdays, and Sundays.\n\nMaritime Attack is available on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.\n\nFierce Assault is available on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.\n\nTactical Training is available every day of the week.\n\n<color=#92fc63>Airstrikes</color> are highly effective for <color=#92fc63>Tactical Training (Aviation)</color>.\n<color=#92fc63>Main Fleet Salvos</color> are highly effective for <color=#92fc63>Tactical Training (Shelling)</color>.\n<color=#92fc63>Vanguard Torpedoes</color> are highly effective for <color=#92fc63>Tactical Training (Torpedo)</color>.\n\nCompleting a Daily Raid stage with an S rating will unlock the quick battle option for that stage.\n- Quick battle allows you to challenge that stage multiple times at once.\n- Carrying out quick battles will skip the battle and grant you rewards according to the number of battles carried out.\n- Quick battles do not consume Oil, but also do not grant Commander or Ship EXP.\n- Quick battles will not affect the Morale or Affection of your ships.\n- Quick battle sortie victories will not affect your number of victories or victory rate on your profile page.\n- Quick battles count towards the progress of certain missions such as:\n  Obtain victory with a B/A/S rating.\n  Complete Daily Raids.\n  Defeat small/medium/large fleets.\n- Quick battles will not count towards the completion of character story missions."

Starting Development:\nYou can begin development on a blueprint ship once you meet her development requirements, which are shown at the center of the Shipyard screen when a ship has been selected.\nTo start developing a ship, select one and tap the Commence button. You can only develop 1 blueprint ship at a time.\n\n2. Development Tasks:\nThe ship you've chosen to develop will unlock after you complete all her development tasks.\nAfter starting development, you will immediately gain access to the first task, and each subsequent task will unlock in order at 24-hour intervals.\nSome tasks may have prerequisites before you can begin making progress.\n\n3. Changing Your Development Target:\nWhile you cannot develop 2 ships at once, you can switch which one you're developing before you complete all tasks.\nAny progress you've made on your current development tasks, as well as the unlocked tasks themselves, will be saved if you choose to switch development targets.\nOnce you do this, you must wait 24 hours before you can change targets again.\n\n4. Completing Development:\nUpon completing all development tasks for a ship, she will join your dock and you unlock the ability to Enhance her.\nTo begin development on a new blueprint ship, you must go to the Development Dock and select one. New development targets are not chosen automatically.\n\n5. Enhancing blueprint Ships:\nIn contrast to ordinary ships, blueprint ships require Blueprints to be Enhanced. Blueprints are mainly acquired through conducting research at the Research Academy.\nEnhancing a blueprint ship will raise her stats, unlock new skills, and give her new abilities, similar to ordinary ships.\n\n6. Enhancing with Coins:\nSome blueprint ships can also be Enhanced and undergo Fate Simulation with Coins as a substitute for Blueprints. \nThe Coin cost depends on how many times you've used this method of Enhancement previously in a day. The first 15 times each day are discounted.\nThe following table lists the Coin cost per number of Blueprints substituted:\n1 to 2: Free\n3 to 4: 90% discount\n5 to 7: 80% discount\n8 to 9: 60% discount\n10 to 15: 30% discount\n16 and onward: 0% discount; Blueprint costs 1,500 Coins each.\nThe game will automatically calculate the Coin cost for you when using this method of Enhancement. The Coin cost resets daily at 4:00 AM.\n\n7. blueprint Ship Level Caps:\nblueprint ships do not need to be Limit Broken to be able to reach level 100. However, past that, you must still use Cognitive Chips and Coins to further increase their level caps. \n\n8. Fate Simulation:\nOnce a blueprint ship reaches Development Level 30, she can undergo Fate Simulation, etching a historical record of sorts into her hull to be more akin to regular ships.\nIn gameplay terms, Fate Simulation will allow you to use additional Blueprints to further enhance the capabilities of your blueprint ship.\nFate Simulation is done in 5 steps. The first 4 steps grant a boost to the ship's Luck stat, and the final 5th step grants an upgrade to one of her skills.\nYou can also use Coins in place of Blueprints. Please refer to section 6 above for more details.\n\n9. Battle Simulations:\nYou can preview the performance of certain blueprints through the Battle Simulation mode.\nTo access it, simply select a ship and tap the Battle Simulation button. You will then be sent into a special battle with the ship you selected.\n\nPlease note that the ships' stats and loadouts are preset in this mode, and may not accurately reflect their real performance."

In essence, you will gain the most benefits by leveling all the ships you have in your Dock.\n\nThe Tech Mechanics can be separated into two distinct types: Fleet Tech and Faction Tech.\n\nFleet Tech:\n1. The Fleet Tech mechanic grants buffs, which are unlocked by leveling your ships, to your entire fleet. \n2. You can view your collection and Tech acquisition statuses on the Fleet Tech screen.\n3.

By increasing a faction's Tech Level, you can further increase the buffs that it gives.\n4. To increase a faction's Tech Level, you must spend <color=#92fc63>Coins</color> and meet the Tech Point requirement for that faction.\n5. Lastly, you can only increase the Tech level of one faction at a time.\n\nAbout Tech Points:\n1. To increase a faction's Tech Level, you need to have collected a certain amount of Tech Points from ships of that faction. \n2. From the Faction Tech screen, you can view how many Tech Points you have with each faction.\n3. You can acquire Tech Points through the following means:\n- <color=#92fc63>Registering</color> a new ship in your Library- <color=#92fc63>Fully Limit Breaking</color> a ship- Getting a ship to <color=#92fc63>Level 120</color>\n4.

During this campaign, commanders can complete ingame tasks to receive votes which they can give to their favorite shipgirls.\nThe poll will be conducted in 5 rounds: Qualifiers, Qualifier Comeback, Groups, Finals Comeback, and lastly, Finals.\n\n- Popularity Poll Rules:\nVotes from commanders across all servers will be pooled together during each round of voting. After the votes are in, the winners will proceed to the next round.\nIn the event of a tie during the Qualifiers round, the shipgirl who reached that number of votes first will be the one to advance.\nIn the event of a tie during any round after the Qualifiers, the shipgirl who ranked higher during the Qualifiers round will be the one to advance.\n\nThe 3 winners of the previous global server Popularity Poll have entered the popularity Hall of Fame, and are excluded from the voting list.\nCollaboration-exclusive characters, META ships, µ ships, and any ships implemented after October 14th, 2021, are also excluded from this list. PR/DR ships are still eligible, assuming they don't also fit into any of the above criteria.\n\nThe winners of the previous Popularity Poll (Amagi, Laffey, and Bismarck) have been given a special story snippet each, which can be viewed through the Hall of Fame, located on the Popularity Poll event banner. Commanders can also unlock special commemorative chat frames through this banner.\n\n- Voting Schedule:\n\n1. Qualifiers Round:\nBegins after the October 14th maintenance, ends on October 25th, 23:59 server time.\nA total of 451 ships will participate in this round of voting. The top 200 shipgirls with the most votes will move on to the Groups round.\nThe individual shipgirl vote totals will not be shown for this round, only their ranks.\n\n2. Qualifiers Comeback Round:\nBegins at midnight server time on October 28th, ends on November 1st, 23:59 server time.\nAll shipgirls who didn't advance in the previous round will participate in this one. The top 15 shipgirls with the most votes will move on to the Finals Comeback round.\n3. Groups Round:\nGroup A: begins at midnight server time on November 4th, ends on November 8th, 23:59 server time.\nGroup B: begins at midnight server time on November 11th, ends on November 15th, 23:59 server time.\nGroup C: begins at midnight server time on November 18th, ends on November 22nd, 23:59 server time.\nGroup D: begins at midnight server time on November 25th, ends on November 29th, 23:59 server time.\nGroup E: begins at midnight server time on December 2nd, ends on December 6th, 23:59 server time.\nShipgirls that advanced to the Groups round are sorted into 5 groups of 40 shipgirls per group. The top 4 shipgirls within each group with the most votes will move on to the Finals round, and those with the top 5 to 12 most votes within each group will move on to the Finals Comeback round.\n\n4. Finals Comeback Round:\nBegins at midnight server time on December 9th, ends on December 12th, 23:59 server time.\nThe participants of this round will be the top 15 winners of the Qualifiers Comeback round, and the 40 shipgirls who barely didn't make the cut during the Groups round. The top 12 shipgirls who receive the most votes this round move on to the Finals.\n\n5. Finals Round:\nBegins at midnight server time on December 17th, ends on December 23rd, 23:59 server time.\nThe participants of this round will be the top 12 winners of the Finals Comeback round, and the top 4 winners of each group during the Groups round, for a total of 32 shipgirls who'll compete for the final round of voting.\n\n- Final Results Announcement:\n\nOnce each step has concluded, barring the Finals round, the voting results will be announced the next day at 12:00 both in the game client and on the poll website.\nOnce the Finals round has concluded, the final results will be announced on Twitter and Facebook the following day after server maintenance.\n\n- How to Vote:\n\nAll commanders at Commander level 25 and above are eligible to vote with the use of Ballots. Ballots can be obtained the following two ways:\n\n1) By completing special missions available during the voting period. These can be viewed from the Missions menu.\n2) By sortieing and defeating Boss fleets in Campaign Chapters 3 and above to earn a Certificate of Support.\nCommanders can use their Certificates of Support on the Campaign overworld screen or the Popularity Poll banner to receive Support Points.\nSupport Points will in turn give the commander Ballots based on how many Points they earned.\nCommanders can then use their Ballots to vote for their favorite shipgirls with the Vote button on the Popularity Poll banner.\nBe aware that once each step of the Poll has concluded, all unspent Ballots will disappear from your inventory.\n\n- More Info about Certificates of Support:\n\n1. Commanders can obtain a Certificate of Support by defeating Boss nodes on Campaign (Normal mode only) and Event maps (excluding through War Archives.)\n2. Commanders can only possess 1 Certificate of Support at a time. It can be used on the Campaign overworld map or from the Popularity Poll banner.\n3. When using their Certificate of Support, commanders will be sent to a screen with the chibi sprites of several characters. By tapping the chibis in the direction that the Manjuu is pointing, the Certificate of Support will be spent and the commander will receive Support Points.\n4. The Certificate of Support will disappear from your inventory if not used within a certain time.\n5. Certificates of Support obtained from higher level Campaign maps give more Support Points. The number of points earned per Chapter is shown in the table below:\n\nChapter 3: 120 Points\nChapter 4: 150 Points\nChapter 5: 180 Points\nChapter 6: 220 Points\nChapter 7: 270 Points\nChapter 8: 350 Points\nChapter 9: 450 Points\nChapter 10: 550 Points\nChapter 11: 700 Points\nChapter 12: 850 Points\nChapter 13: 1,000 Points\nChapter 14: 1,150 Points."

About the Detection Gauge:\n\nThe Detection Gauge represents how close the enemy is to detecting the presence of your carriers. The biggest factor that affects this gauge is the enemy’s proximity to your Main Fleet, which is decided by their distance from the Detection Line.\n\nHowever, other factors affect this gauge as well. The Detection Gauge increases:\n\n- When an enemy crosses the Detection Line\n\n- When an enemy ship or aircraft reaches the left-hand side of the screen\n\n- When a friendly carrier launches an Airstrike\n\n- When the skills of certain friendly carriers activate\n\n- When a friendly carrier catches fire (when this happens, the Detection Gauge will not go below a certain threshold until the fire is put out)\n\nThe Detection Gauge will decrease as long as there are no enemies past the Detection Line.\n\nEach carrier has a separate Detection Gauge, and the higher their AVI stat, the longer it will take for them to be Detected.\n\n2. The Detection Gauge During Exercises:\n\nThe Detection Gauge will not decrease in Exercise Battles. Additionally, once the opponent’s fleet gets near enough to your Main Fleet, all of your carriers will enter the Detected state."

        "info": "- Augment Modules Overview - \nAugment Modules are a special type of gear. A shipgirl must be at Max Limit Break to equip them, unless she is a META ship, a blueprint ship (PR/DR) or a ship of UR rarity.\nThese modules can, among other things, raise your shipgirls' stats, improve certain skills, and clear incoming enemy shells.\n\nShipgirls can only equip one module each, and some modules may only be equipped by specific shipgirls.\nYour modules are stored in a depot separate from your primary Gear Depot.\n\n- Obtaining Augment Modules -\nModules can be obtained through a Daily Raid and crafting.\nThe Daily Raid can be attempted up to twice per week, and is split into 2 types of missions. One yields Augment Modules, the other yields materials used on Augment Modules.\nModules can be crafted either from the Craft tab on the Depot menu, or through the Augment gear slot on the Dock screen.\n\nCrafting these modules requires Augment Module Cores and Coins. However, doing so will also let you use Augment Module Stones and spare Augment Modules to craft modules with higher starting Upgrade EXP.\nYou can also craft unique modules for shipgirls who have them. This is done via the crafting menu on the Dock screen for applicable shipgirls.\n\n- Augment Module Attributes -\nModule attributes are divided into 3 categories: base stats, conversion attributes, and module effects.\n\n· Base Stats\nBase stats are the module's inherent statistics, which vary based on the particular module. These stats can be increased by upgrading and uncapping the module.\nUpgrading a module requires Upgrade EXP, which is granted through the use of Augment Module Stones and the recycling of spare Augment Modules.\nUncapping requires Augment Module Cores, Coins, and upgrade materials. Uncapping increases a module's rarity and also resets its Upgrade Level. Currently, modules can only be upgraded from Rare to Elite rarity.\n\n· Conversion Attributes\nConversion attributes are variable stats, determined randomly within a value range specific to a given module.\nThese attributes can be rerolled through the use of Augment Module Stones. When you reroll a module's attributes, you can choose to either apply the change to overwrite the previous attributes, or cancel the conversion.\n\n· Module Effects\nModule effects are special effects that unlock after you've upgraded a given module to a certain level.\nSome unique modules also have effects that improve the skills of the particular shipgirl associated with it.\n\n- Augment Module Behavior in Combat -\nSome modules have a slash attack as their module effect. This attack is capable of clearing enemy shells and is activated automatically.\nThe slash attack's pattern and range, as well as the ammo type it is capable of clearing, all depend on the kind of Augment Module equipped as well as the hull type of the shipgirl equipping it and how many have it equipped.\n\nShipgirls with this type of Augment Module can store up to 1 slash attack.\nWhen she has a slash attack charged, she will perform it automatically either after taking damage, or after 5 seconds pass without her having taken damage.\nThe slash attack will start recharging after it is performed. All slash attacks require 15 seconds to recharge."

A new feature, research queueing, has been added to the Research Academy.\nYou can now queue up research projects if you meet all their completion requirements. Queued projects will be completed in the order they were added to the queue, and once added, cannot be removed.\nYour research queue can hold up to 5 projects at a time. When you add a project to the queue, the list of available research projects will be refreshed.\n\n\n- Update -\nThe Research Academy has received an update with the addition of series 4 PRs/DRs.\n\n1. New series 4 research projects have been added.\n\n2. If you possess enough Blueprints to fully Enhance (including Fate Simulation) a PR/DR, you will no longer get Catch-Up research projects specific to that ship.\nFor example, if you only have Monarch fully Fate Simulated (or have enough Blueprints to do so) among all PR1 ships and set your Research Focus to PR1 ships, you will receive projects for all PR1 ships except Monarch.\n\nIf you have Research Focus set to a specific PR/DR series and you've fully Enhanced all ships from that series (or have enough Blueprints to do so), you will get research projects for all ships from that series.\nConversely, if you have Research Focus disabled, you will only receive research projects for ships that you've not fully Enhanced (or have enough Blueprints to do so for).\n\nOtherwise, the amount of Blueprints you possess for a given ship does not affect your probability of getting research projects for her.\n\n\n- Update -\nThe Research Academy has received an update with the addition of series 3 PRs/DRs.\n\n1. New series 3 research projects have been added.\nSeries 3 research projects are marked with the roman numeral \"III\" in the top right corner of the project.\n\n2. The Research Focus menu has been completely revamped.  Now when you wish to focus on a particular PR/DR series, you can choose between series 1, 2, and 3.\nFocusing on a series will increase the likelihood you'll get research projects from the corresponding series, with at least 3 of them guaranteed to be from the chosen series.\n\nAdditionally, with the new Catch-Up feature, you can prioritize a ship of a given PR/DR series and receive additional Blueprints for her.\nSetting an active Catch-Up ship is done through the Research Focus menu."

It is required to initiate a META Showdown against a past META ship.\n· You can obtain up to <color=#92fc63>200</color> data every day. Data below the cap that went unused will carry over into the next day.\n· It costs <color=#92fc63>100</color> data to initiate a Showdown against a past META ship.\n\n- Setting and Changing Analysis Targets -\nOnce you've unlocked a META ship's dossier on the Dossier Analysis screen, you may initiate a Showdown against her.\n· You may freely switch to another META ship if you want to analyze her dossier instead.\n\n- Dossier Analysis Showdowns -\nYour first attempt at a Showdown does not cost Oil. Your Oil cost decreases with each subsequent attempt, starting at <color=#92fc63>40</color> and eventually reaching <color=#92fc63>0</color>.\nShowdowns initiated via Dossier Analysis do not count toward the daily cap on ordinary META Showdowns.\n· You gain Sync Points for the META ship you're after once her HP reaches 0.\n· A Showdown remains active for 24 hours. If you do not finish it within this time, you will have to reinitiate the fight.\n· Dossier Analysis Showdowns have a fixed Corrosion Level of 15.\n\n- Support in Dossier Analysis Showdowns -\nFriends and members of the same Guild who have unlocked Dossier Analysis can assist each other during Showdowns.\n<color=#92fc63>Assisting a friend or guildmate does not yield any rewards, but neither does it cost Oil nor consume your daily Showdown attempts.</color>\n· Up to 30 players may participate in the same Showdown.\n\n- Showdown Combat Overview -\nMuch like with ordinary META Showdowns, submarines and Meowfficers cannot participate in Dossier Analysis Showdowns.\nShipgirls taking part in the Showdown do not gain EXP, but they also do not lose Morale.\nYou cannot stop a battle once it has begun. If the game is exited at any point during the battle, one of the following penalties is applied:\n· If you are the Showdown's initiator, any spent Oil is not reimbursed, and all your damage dealt in that battle is negated.\n· If you are assisting another player, all your damage dealt in that battle is negated.\n\n- Auto-Deploy Overview -\nAfter you've initiated a Dossier Analysis Showdown and completed the first attempt, the Auto-Deploy feature becomes available for the rest of that Showdown.\nThe Oil cost of running Auto-Deploy is based on how much damage you dealt to the META ship on the first attempt. This damage is used to calculate how many battles it will take to defeat the META ship and, subsequently, the total Oil cost of those battles.\n· Using Auto-Deploy costs the same amount of Oil as fighting the META ship manually, with an Oil cap of 200.\n· Auto-Deploy will automatically defeat the META ship in 15 minutes unless you disable it manually. Doing so does not reimburse the spent Oil and all your damage dealt is negated."
